# Digital Property Registration System

This is a lightweight desktop application developed in Python using Tkinter and SQLAlchemy, designed for digital registration, review, and supervision of construction projects in the Municipality of Sari. The software allows property data entry, search/filtering, editing, deletion, architectural compliance assessment, and CSV export. Data is stored in a local SQLite database.
